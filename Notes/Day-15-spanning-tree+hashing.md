# What is a Spanning Tree?
- **A spanning tree is a subset of a graph `G`, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges.**
- **Example:**
```
		A         A          A         A
	   / \  =>   / \  (or)  /    (or)   \
	  C---B     C   B      C---B     C---B
```
### Applications of Spanning Tree:
- Civil Network Planning.
- Computer Network Routing Protocol.
- Cluster Analysis.
# Hash Table:
- Hash table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner.
- In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value.
- Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
- Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of data.
- Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hashing techniques to generate an index, where an technique is used to generate an index, where an element is to be inserted or to be located from.
# Hashing:
- **Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.**
- We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values.
- Consider an example of hash table of size 20, and the following items are to be stored.
- Item are in the (key, value) format.
