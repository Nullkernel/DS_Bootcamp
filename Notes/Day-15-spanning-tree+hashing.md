# What is a Spanning Tree?
- **A spanning tree is a subset of a graph `G`, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges.**
- **Example:**
```
		A         A          A         A
	   / \  =>   / \  (or)  /    (or)   \
	  C---B     C   B      C---B     C---B
```
### Applications of Spanning Tree:
- Civil Network Planning.
- Computer Network Routing Protocol.
- Cluster Analysis.
# Hashing:
- **Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.**
- Hash table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner.
- We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values.
- Consider an example of hash table of size 20, and the following items are to be stored.
- Item are in the (key, value) format.
- A hash table is a data structure that stored the data in associative manner.
- In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value.
- Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
